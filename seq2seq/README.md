# Learning SQL-to-text with Sequence-to-sequence Model
## Code Contributor: Fanjie Kong

#### Description:
* Basic Pytorch dependency
* Tested on Pytorch 1.10, Python 3.7 
* Preprocessed WikiSQL data: <br />
      - train_sql_text_no_pad.csv <br />
      - dev_sql_text_no_pad.csv <br />
      - test_sql_text_no_pad.csv <br />

* How to replicate our proejct: <br />
      - RNN experiments: RNN_seq2seq.ipynb <br />
      - LSTM experiments: LSTM_seq2seq.ipynb <br />
      - Transformer experiments: Transformer_seq2seq.ipynb <br />
